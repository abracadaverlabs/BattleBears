Read Me - Battle Bears (Pat Owens edition)

In this exciting new take on the Battle Bears classic, the amazing Patrick Owens has added a shrink ray, allowing bears to shrink in size when they're not interested in doing anything else. This will give them the tactical advantage of being harder to hit!

Other updates:
-Camera pivot now clamped to a 170 degree range
-Running speed clamped to preferred values (default set to 33 percent for backwards runnning and 66 percent for strafing)

Recent downgrades:
-Infinite double jump is nerfed. Bears can no longer fly.
